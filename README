Custom caching strategies for the MachII (CFML) framework. http://www.mach-ii.com

TimespanNativeCfmlStrategy.cfc
------------------------------
This uses the cfml engine's native cachePut() and cacheGet() methods. Written using Railo, but according to the CF9 documentation, it should also be CF9 compatible. Any compatibility issues on any cfml engines would be gratefully received.

Railo (and other cfml engines) provide a way to define different cache stores. This abstraction makes it trivial to switch your MachII caching between different cache servers, Memcached, EHCache, CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.

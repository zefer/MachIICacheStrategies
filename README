Custom caching strategies for the MachII (CFML) framework. http://www.mach-ii.com

NativeCache.cfc
---------------
This uses the cfml engine's native cachePut() and cacheGet() methods. Written using Railo, but would require very little (if any) change to the PUT/GET methods to run this on any cfml engine which has implemented cachePut() and cacheGet().

Railo (and other cfml engines) provide a way to define different cache stores. This abstraction makes it trivial to switch your MachII caching between different cache servers, Memcached, EHCache, CouchDB, MongoDB, etc.
